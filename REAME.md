# Inventory Management System (Python CLI)

This is a professional command-line interface (CLI) application developed to manage product inventories using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.

Developed as part of my Computer Science studies at TSI (Transport and Telecommunication Institute) to practice data structures, logic handling, and algorithm design.

## Key Features

- Product Management: Add new products with specific names, prices, and stock quantities.
- Sales Logic: Search for products by name and decrease stock levels upon sale, including automated "Out of Stock" validation.
- Inventory Reporting: List all products currently stored in the system with a formatted view.
- Financial Aggregation: Automatically calculate the total monetary value of the entire inventory (Price \* Quantity).
- Low Stock Alerts: A filtering system to identify and display items with critical stock levels (less than 3 units).

## Technical Implementation

- Language: Python 3.x
- Architecture: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Methods, Encapsulation).
- Logic: List comprehension, "Found" flag techniques, and case-insensitive string matching for better user experience.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command:
   python inventory_manager.py
